            <p>I consider myself to be a professional that is well-organized, 
              disciplined, and committed to life-long learning.</p>
  
            <p>As a software engineering professional, I am dedicated to learning 
              technologies and good practices to develop software applications that automate 
              tasks, extract insights or recognize patterns from data. I am dedicated to 
              writing clean code that is easy to maintain and test. I prefer to program 
              in Python programming language but also can work with Java or C#:</p>
            
            <p>I am experienced with analyzing semi-structured data, such as XML, 
              to extract insights from bulk data (millions of files). I  also have practical 
              experience using machine learning & deep learning classifier models (in Python) 
              for natural language processing (NLP) - automatic text classification.</p>
            
            <p>Furthermore, I am experienced with database management systems (DBMS) like 
              MySQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j. I have done projects that push and pull data from 
              these databases (Take a look at my portfolio).</p>
