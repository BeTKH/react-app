          <section>As a software engineering professional, I am dedicated to learning 
            technologies and good practices to develop software applications that automate 
            tasks, extract insights or recognize patterns from data. I am dedicated to 
            writing clean code that is easy to maintain and test. I prefer to program 
            in Python programming language but also can work with Java or C#: </section>
            <br>
          <section>I am experienced with analyzing semi-structured data, such as XML, 
            to extract insights from bulk data (millions of files). I  also have practical 
            experience using machine learning & deep learning classifier models (in Python) 
            for natural language processing (NLP) - automatic text classification.</section>
            <br>
          <section>Furthermore, I am experienced with database management systems (DBMS) like 
            MySQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j. I have done projects that push and pull data from 
            these databases (Take a look at my portfolio).</section>
